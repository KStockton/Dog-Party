Dog Party

The project I was assigned in Turing 1811 was to create a website that looks very similar to the image below. The project consited of HTML and CSS. The project helps teach HTML and CSS while learning all the different ways to write code for HTML and CSS. The project challenged us to not use grid of flex boat to move images around the webpage.

Motivation
I the motivation behind this project is to allow the students to get familar typing out the HTML and CSS languages. It helps promote the use of several things such as wireframing, assigning classes, id's for CSS alterations, floating items and essentially trying to build a website from an image.
